# Customer Segmentation
 This is a repository of my personal project about customer segmentation. The data used in this project is a supermarket demographic customer's data and also purchase data. 

There are 3 notebooks in this repo. Ideal order for reading: `customer_segmentation.ipynb` -> `customer_purchase_EDA.ipynb` -> `customer_purchase_model.ipynb`
